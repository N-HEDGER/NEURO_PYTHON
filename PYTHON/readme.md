## Why Python? 

It’s probably worth discussing more general reasons why Python is an appropriate engine for fMRI analysis.

1. Firstly, Python is free.

2. Python is also a default installation on many modern computers – it doesn’t need to be downloaded or installed in many cases.

3. Next, it is obviously important for our practices to be future-proof. The future looks quite bright for python as it is becoming increasingly popular. Recently, [google search queries](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=US&q=learn%20python,learn%20java) for ‘learn python’ have overtaken those for 'learn java' and other popular languages. Python is also the most popular introductory programming language at many Universities.

4. Python is also a very intuitive, easy to learn language. Python programs are on average [3-5 times shorter](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/comparisons/) than the equivalent java program. If you know a bit of R or MATLAB scripting then you should be able to pick up python quite quickly.

5. It is very easy to share Python scripts with other researchers.
