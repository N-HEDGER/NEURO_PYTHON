# Welcome!

Here I will host some notebooks for illustrating some useful tools for fmri data processing in python.

Additionally, this repo will also be be used to host some useful functions.


I have also provided some general readmes on why I like to use [python](/PYTHON) and [nipype](/NIPYPE) and [nilearn/nibabel](/NILEARN_NIBABEL).
