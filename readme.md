# Welcome!

Here I will host some notebooks for illustrating some useful tools for fmri data processing in python. Specifically, nipype, nilearn and nibabel. These all sit in the [nipy](https://nipy.org/) family of packages.

Each of these I will accompany with a set of slides.

I have also provided some general readmes on why I like to use [python](/PYTHON) and [nipype](/NIPYPE) and [nilearn/nibabel](/NILEARN_NIBABEL).
